# MoveMod

**Drag players with your mouse or finger in Among Us.**
A lightweight, client-side mod that lets you pick up and move characters around the map.

## ✨ What it Does

MoveMod lets you **grab any player** and physically **drag them anywhere**:

* Smooth dragging on your own screen
* Synced movement when you’re the host
* Works on both **PC** and **mobile**

## 🖱️ How to Use (PC)

* Hold **right-click** on a player to grab them
* Move your mouse to drag
* Release to drop

## 📱 How to Use (Mobile)

* Touch and hold a player with **one finger**
* Drag them around normally
* The mod automatically handles multi-touch to avoid glitches

## 📦 How to Install

1. Install **BepInEx** in [BepInBuilds](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be).
2. Place **MoveMod.dll** inside:
   ```
   BepInEx/plugins/
   ```
3. Start the game — the mod loads automatically.

## 🔒 Who Can Drag Players?

To avoid trolling or abuse, dragging only works if:

* You are the **host**, or
* You **own** the player (local control), or
* You are in **Tutorial mode**
